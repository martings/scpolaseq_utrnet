# scPolASeq-UTRNet

`scpolaseq_utrnet` builds exploratory, population-specific 3′UTR regulatory graphs from frozen scPolASeq PAS counts. The PBMC 1k MVP uses the completed `pbmc_1k_v3` replica and its technically concordant downstream notebook output. It does not rerun alignment, Sierra, SCAPTURE, or PAS discovery.

## PBMC 1k quick start on Deepthought

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[test]'
export UTRNET_UPSTREAM=/path/to/completed/scPolASeq/pbmc1k
export UTRNET_DOWNSTREAM=/path/to/executed/downstream/outputs/pbmc1k
utrnet audit --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml
utrnet candidates --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml
utrnet ingest --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene SAT1
utrnet build-graph --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene SAT1
utrnet compare --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene SAT1
utrnet render --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene SAT1
utrnet build-graph --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene CORO1B
utrnet render --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --gene CORO1B
utrnet sensitivity --config configs/pbmc1k.yaml --dry-run
```

Set the two input paths to the completed scPolASeq run and its executed downstream notebook output before running the commands. The configuration rejects unset path variables. Outputs are written under `outputs/pbmc1k/<gene ID>/` and excluded from Git. The HTML explorer, static PNG, normalized CSV tables, Cytoscape JSON, GraphML, and provenance are generated locally. See [PBMC validation](docs/PBMC1K_VALIDATION.md).

SAT1 and CORO1B form the first two-gene panel because both have observed alternative PAS and compatible 3′UTR sequence models. CORO1B also has ambiguous alternative sequence models, which stay flagged. `site_retention.csv` reports sites shared across compatible PAS, restricted to some PAS, or dependent on the selected transcript model. The bundled RBP motif subset is reproducibly extracted from ATtRACT with a pinned archive checksum. The bundled MirGeneDB human mature sequences supply exact miRNA seed-match predictions. IFITM3 remains an APA observation but its highlighted proximal PAS lacks a compatible annotated 3′UTR model in this audit; it is not used to claim a regulatory switch. ZSWIM6 remains excluded pending its large-span mapping review.

## Run without Deepthought

```bash
python examples/make_fixture.py /tmp/utrnet-fixture
utrnet build-graph --config /tmp/utrnet-fixture/config.yaml
utrnet render --config /tmp/utrnet-fixture/config.yaml
python -m pytest -q
```

The fixture contains two cells, two strands, exact barcodes with `-1` suffixes, a synthetic 3′UTR motif retained only in a distal isoform, and a prior-only miRNA site. It is synthetic and makes no biological claim.

## Evidence and interpretation

Observed: Sierra UMI counts, curated cell identities, and mRNA expression. Annotation-derived: candidate transcript/PAS associations and reconstructed 3′UTR sequences. External experimental evidence: ATtRACT's ELAVL1 and ZFP36 AUUUA motif records from other contexts. Predicted: matches of those motifs and MirGeneDB-derived exact miRNA seeds to SAT1 isoforms, plus interaction scores. Missing by default: RNAplfold accessibility if the executable is absent, measured RBP/AGO occupancy at SAT1 in PBMC, and endogenous miRNA abundance. The optional miRNA genomic-site import uses a versioned TSV; both miRNA evidence modes remain prior-only without small-RNA measurements.

Scores expose usage, model weight, motif presence, accessibility, evidence factor, and abundance factor separately. Missing accessibility or abundance yields an explicitly labeled partial score. The explorer displays up to eight representative regulator patterns for legibility; its site-retention and interaction tables and exported graphs retain the full candidate set. Results compare lineages within one biological sampling context; cells are not independent biological replicates.
